## Step 1: Download Adobe CS6 Master Collection
 
The first step is to download the Adobe CS6 Master Collection installer from a reliable source. You can find it on Archive.org[^1^] or other websites that host old software versions. Make sure you download the correct version for your operating system (Windows or Mac) and language. The file size is about 6-8 GB depending on the language.
 
## Step 2: Disable your Internet connection
 
The next step is to disable your Internet connection or pull out the network cable from your computer. This is to prevent Adobe from verifying your serial number and activation code online. You also need to make sure you don't have any of these entries in your hosts file:

    127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
    127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com

The hosts file is located at C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts on Windows and /etc/hosts on Mac. You can edit it with a text editor like Notepad or TextEdit.
 
## Step 3: Install Adobe CS6 Master Collection
 
The third step is to install Adobe CS6 Master Collection with a serial number generated from a keygen. A keygen is a program that can create random serial numbers and activation codes for software. You can find one on CG Persia[^2^] or other websites that host cracks and keygens for software. Download the keygen and run it as administrator on Windows or with sudo on Mac.
 
When you run the keygen, you will see a window like this:

Select Adobe Master Collection CS6 from the drop-down menu and click Generate Serial. Copy the serial number and paste it into the installer when prompted. Do not close the keygen yet.
 
When the installer asks you to connect to the Internet and retry, click Connect Later.
 
## Step 4: Activate Adobe CS6 Master Collection
 
The fourth step is to activate Adobe CS6 Master Collection with an activation code generated from the keygen. To do this, you need to launch an Adobe application (such as Photoshop or Illustrator) and confirm that you have a connection problem and want to activate offline.
 
You will see a window like this:

A request code will be generated. Copy the request code and paste it into the keygen where it says Request. Click Generate Activation and copy the activation code.
 
Paste the activation code into the activation window and click Activate.
 
## Step 5: Update Adobe CS6 Master Collection
 
The final step is to update Adobe CS6 Master Collection to the latest version available. To do this, you need to re-enable your Internet connection and run the Adobe Application Manager 6.2[^1^]. This will allow you to download and install updates for all the applications in the suite.
 
After updating, you need to disable your Internet connection again and run a script that will block Adobe from contacting its servers. You can find this script on Archive.org[^1^] or CG Persia[^2^]. It is called disable\_activation.cmd on Windows and disable\_activation\_osx on Mac.
 
Run the script as administrator on Windows or with sudo on Mac. It will add
